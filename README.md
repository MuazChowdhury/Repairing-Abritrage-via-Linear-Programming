# Repairing Abritrage via Linear Programming
(Reproducing results of the paper "Detecting and repairing arbitrage in traded option prices") Constructing an arbitrage-free call price surface by first characterising static arbitrage as a set of linear inequalities, and then using linear programming/optimisation, with these linear inequalities as constraints, to "minimally" perturb the option prices.
