# Repairing Abritrage via Linear Programming
This project is a coursework that was completed for the module 'Selected Topics in Quantitative Finance' on the MSc Mathematics and Finance program at Imperial College London, which received a Distinction grade. We reviewed, summarised and produced our own code to reproduce the results of the paper 'Detecting and repairing arbitrage in traded option prices', showing how to construct an arbitrage-free call price surface by first characterising static arbitrage as a set of linear inequalities, and then using linear programming/optimisation, with these linear inequalities as constraints, to "minimally" perturb the option prices.
